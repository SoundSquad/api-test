      "description": "Moes Alley presents Carsie Blanton with special guest Adron!Saturday, October 12thDoors: 8pm / Show: 9pm$20 in advance / $25 day of the show21+*Fan presale starts on Monday, March 18th at 10am PT**Public onsale starts on Friday, March 22nd at 10am PT*CARSIE BLANTONCarsie Blanton is a songwriter with hooks, chutzpah, and revolutionary optimism. It is possible to face the world as it is - rapidly heating, ruled by grifters, ravaged by profitable wars - and still have hope, she says of her forthcoming release, After the Revolution. Not the narrow, grasping hope you might hang on an election or a billionaire, but a patient, zoomed-out hope.Blantons ninth full-length album draws from her many influences. Tracks like My Good Friends evoke her childhood in Appalachia, while Aint We Got Fun showcases a musical roux earned from a decade spent in New Orleans. The title track, a hard-rocking protest anthem, shows that her commitment to the good fight need not obscure her considerable acumen as a writer and musician. With her unique mix of humor, craft, and social critique, Blanton has amassed a small menagerie of viral hits (Rich People, Shit List, Fishin With You) and a dedicated fan base. In addition to fifteen years on the road with her band, Blanton volunteers as a political organizer, and was recently published in The Nation.ADRONWith otherworldly whistling, adventures in language, kaleidoscopic guitar work and a voice like whipped cream, Atlanta-bred, LA-based singer-songwriter Adron (pronounced AY-drawn) seems to have absorbed and synthesized the history of global pop music into her own wholly unique oeuvre. Since the release of her latest full-length album Water Music and a surprise tour opening for Steely Dans Donald Fagen, Adron brightened the dark days of pandemic lockdown with her single Song About My Computer, what she called her whimsical pessimist expression of comic distemper. Adron has shared stages and studios with allies like Helado Negro, Stereolabs Leiticia Sadier, Os Mutantes, Jolie Holland, Dent May and Devendra Banhart. Now shes hitting US tour routes while preparing the way for her next offering, an LP called The Trickster, conceptually centered around love, loss, psychedelics and wanderlust.",
