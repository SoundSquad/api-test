      "description": "21+Summer Dean puts on a hell-of-a show. Armed with three albums, constant tours, and a hot five-piece band behind her, Summer struts onto every stage with the confidence and vulnerability of a songstress that has cemented her place among the top rank Texas tunesmiths. Her live show takes the concert goer on a ride of original songs bleding bravado, vulnerability, and a novelists eye for detail. Whether with her full band or all by herself, listeners and watchers are treated to an authentic, funny, and honest storyteller performing her way into legendary status. Recently named Texas Country Music Awards Female Artist of the Year, Summer has performed with an array of country aces, including Colter Wall, Marty Stuart, Asleep at the Wheel, Hayes Carll, Silverada (Mike and the Moonpies) and Charley Crockett.Website / facebook / instagram / spotify / youtubeCOUNTRY MUSIC IN D.C. | Some would say that could never work -- Christopher Colletta s Capital.Website / facebook / instagram / spotify / youtube",
