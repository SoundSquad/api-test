      "description": "Self-described as crunk and dominant, GloRilla is unmistakable in her style, sound and current trajectory to rap domination. Her breakout 2022 hit, the Hitkidd-produced F.N.F. (Let's Go), rocketed GloRilla to rap fame. In less than seven months, the newcomer's hit single was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2022 BET Hip Hop Awards and Best Rap Performance at the 2023 Grammy Awards. GloRilla was also nominated for Favorite Female Hip-Hop Artist at the 2022 American Music Awards. She won the Best Breakthrough Hip Hop Artist award at the 2022 BET Awards. She followed up F.N.F. (Let's Go) with another hit single, Tomorrow 2, a remix featuring Cardi B. The song reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. GloRilla released her first EP, Anyways, Life's Great, in November 2022. Artist lineup subject to change. No Refunds/ No Exchanges",
