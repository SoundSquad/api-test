      "description": "Bendigo Fletcher perform a gorgeously jangly collision of country and folk rock and dreamy psychedelia, the result of which is a batch of story songs graced with so much raw humanity, wildly offbeat humor, and a transcendent sense of wonder. Daniel Nunnelee is truly gifted vocalist who brings an undeniably playful spirit to his existential questioning, and ultimately hopes that listeners might take whatever they need from his songs.",

      "description": "Daniel Nunnelee: June, Baby Fall Tour LIVE at Grog Shopwith Hana EidSunday, October 277pm doors / 8pm showAll Ages$17 advance / $20 day of show+$3 at the door if under 21With the arrival of his self-released breakout single Pick and Choose in 2022, Memphis-born singer/songwriter Daniel Nunnelee introduced the world to his sweetly offbeat and soul-baring form of folk/indie-rock. An instant viral sensation that amassed over a million streams in just ten days, Pick and Choose soon led to the making of June, Baby: a strangely enchanting debut album revealing both his old-soul sensibilities and wide-eyed perspective on finding your way in the world. With its title nodding to his birthday month and to the duality he embodies as a quintessential Gemini, June, Baby explores such emotionally heavy matters as anxiety and anticipatory grief, endlessly showcasing the graceful musicality he first developed by playing guitar in church as a kid. A lifelong nature lover who wrote much of June, Baby at his favorite park and at remote cabins in Mississippi and Colorado, the Nashville-based artist also sets his self-reflection to a one-of-a-kind sound matching its homespun charm with the unbridled energy hes brought to the stage opening for artists like Madi Diaz and Shakey Graves (in addition to headlining his own tours). A truly gifted vocalist who brings an undeniably playful spirit to his existential questioning, Nunnelee ultimately hopes that listeners might take whatever they need from his songs whether its a deeper communion with the natural world that incessantly inspires his music, or a monumental shift in their own outlook on life.",
